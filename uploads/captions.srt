1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 You're glowing, you cover and fracture the light

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,400
 You can't help but shine and I know that

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,600
 You carry the world on your back, but look at you tonight

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,200
 The lights, your face, your eyes, exploding like fire

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,600
 Works in the sky, set fire

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,800
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,200
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,000
 We'll be dancing till the morning, go to baby, won't sleep

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
 Tum, tum, tum, tum, tits, it's dirty body, body, game fire

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week?

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
 We'll be dancing till the morning, go to baby, won't sleep

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
 Tum, tum, tum, tum, tits, it's dirty body, game

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200
 Look what we found, come and reach down

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,800
 Into our hearts and pull us to our feet now

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,400
 You know the truth is, we could disappear

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,000
 Anywhere, as long as I got you there

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
 When the sun dies, till the day shines

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
 When I'm with you, it's not enough time

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,400
 You're on my spring flower, watching you bloom wild

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,600
 We y'all surrounding, but I can only see the lights

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
 Your face, your eyes, exploding like fire

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,200
 Works in the sky, set fire

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week?

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600
 We'll be dancing till the morning, go to baby, won't sleep

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
 Tum, tum, tum, tum, tits, it's dirty body, body, game fire

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week?

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 We'll be dancing till the morning, go to baby, won't sleep

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 Tum, tum, tum, tum, tits, it's dirty body, game fire

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,800
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,800
 You come here and distract you, the light, look at you tonight

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
 Set fire, let's go to the sky, let's go to the sky

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week?

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
 We'll be dancing till the morning, go to baby, won't sleep

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 Tum, tum, tum, tum, tits, it's dirty body, body, game fire

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 Don't you know your body, I could do this all week?

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
 Don't you know your body, why you pushing on me?

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,800
 Shut the lights, your face, your eyes, it's flowing like fire

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 Worms in the sky, shut the lights
